  sentences:
  - You speak Staenish?
  - '*Speaking in Staenish*

    It has been a long time since I spoke my tongue,
    just rarely to trader coming past'
  - It might be too cold for you, that's for sure. But I heard your people also have
    a fort there
  - Just remember, to us, honour and status is above all else. We don't have your
    concept of laws or rights, the strong rule because they are strong
  - Don't mess with a mans cattle, it is his value. Don't overstep a woman in her
    home, she will fight you. We are not cowards, all can fight
  - Above all of us are the dowermachs, the water wizards, who speak for our goddess.
    They settle our blood feuds, advise our kings on what to plant and build
  - They are extremely powerful mages, but between them and the people there is always
    mistrust and strife. Do not get involved in our 500 year old struggles
  - All else you shall learn soon if you can survive, but it is a place unlike this
    completely. My only hope is you shall come to understand it like I do

  sentences:
  - Hmm, I see you've already started the journey but Akhetians have a weak understanding
    of magic. Staenish way is better
  - Remember you only have two hands to cast spells, and that the strength of the
    spell will burn the hand for some time
  - Try to cast stornger spells with one hand, so you always have a hand to cast
    your weaker and faster spells
  - Collect rings of metal, so you cast more powerful spells. But weak spells will
    always be there for you even if you own nothing else
  - Let me teach you some basic spells, ones that will help keep you alive
  - First is Rotbyn's cantrip, a most simple curse that you will always be able to
    fight with. It can be cast very quickly
  - Second is the charm of health, which will give you extra vitality, for fighting
  - Third is a spell that distracts enemies and makes them easier to avoid, very
    good if you want to avoid getting hit
  - Lastly, a spell I helped created, an eternity ago. A healing spell that will
    heal your wounds but it requires tin rings to cast
  - As a final gift, take this wand made of olive wood, if you hold that you shall
    cast magic much faster
  - Go well, learn those spells and seek out others of wisdom. Those in our brotherhood
    will always share knowledge with friends

  - I came here a long time ago, from Staen, I could no longer stay among my people
  - The village then was smaller, the fort was being constructed still, yet of course
    we sought it's safety
  - I am a mach, a wizard in your tongue, though not of any strong skill. But I proved
    services to the people here, including my apprentice who I have taught much about
    herbcraft
  - I can also teach a bit about magic, if you already have had your visions? Staenish
    magic is powerful but requires deep understanding
